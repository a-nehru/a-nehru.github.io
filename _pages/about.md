I’m **Aravind Nehrujee**, a postdoctoral researcher at **Shirley Ryan AbilityLab (SRAlab)** in Chicago, USA. My work focuses on developing technologies and therapies to help people with sensory-motor impairments regain independence and improve their quality of life.

I strive to create tools that are simple to use yet built on strong scientific and clinical foundations. Whether it’s designing robots for rehabilitation or exploring neuromodulation techniques, my goal is to make advanced therapies accessible and Efficacious.

### **My PhD and Postdoc Research**

During my PhD, I developed PLUTO, a hand rehabilitation robot designed to help train motor recovery in individuals with sensory-motor impairments. Over several years, PLUTO underwent four iterations, informed by feedback from patients, clinicians, and researchers. I directly collaborated with more than 100 patients and 50 clinicians, conducting trials with 1,000+ participants across seven centers. This iterative process ensured that PLUTO became a practical and evidence-based tool for rehabilitation.

The system is now being commercialized and was among the first robots used in home-based clinical trials, showcasing its potential to make advanced rehabilitation more accessible. 
In addition to PLUTO, I co-built several other devices aimed at assessing and training sensory-motor function. These projects further deepened my understanding of how technology can be designed to address the diverse needs of patients and clinicians

Building on this foundation, my current postdoctoral work at Shirley Ryan AbilityLab focuses on exploring neuromodulation techniques that enhance the brain and spinal cord’s ability to adapt and recover. These techniques include:

Acute Intermittent Hypoxia (AIH): A method using brief periods of low oxygen to induce neuroplasticity.
Transcutaneous spinal stimulation: A non-invasive technique aimed at improving sensorimotor function.
By expanding my work from mechatronic training solutions to neuromodulation, I aim to integrate these approaches to develop more comprehensive and effective rehabilitation interventions. This evolution allows me to connect engineering and neuroscience, driving innovations that translate directly into clinical impact.

### **My Philosophy**

For me, impactful technologies are not just about complexity or innovation—they must also be **translatable** and **usable**. A tool is only as good as the ease with which people can adopt it, whether it’s a clinician in a busy hospital or a patient recovering at home.

I often think about **Google Search** as an example. On the surface, it’s a simple search box that anyone can use. Behind the scenes, though, it’s powered by complex algorithms like PageRank and BERT, which make it incredibly effective. Similarly, I would like to create rehabilitation tools that feel intuitive to use but are backed by rigorous science and engineering.

This approach ensures that the tools I develop are not only scientifically sound but also practical and scalable for real-world use.

### **How I Got Here**

My journey into rehabilitation engineering began at **CMC Vellore**, one of India’s leading rehabilitation centers. During my master’s, I worked on a **smartphone-based vestibular gaming system** to help patients regain balance. That project sparked my interest in using technology to create meaningful healthcare solutions.

While at CMC, I also visited rural hospitals in **Raxaul, Bihar**, and **Odisha**, where I saw firsthand how limited resources could affect access to care. These experiences shaped my commitment to designing solutions that are **affordable**, **practical**, and **accessible**, ensuring they reach those who need them the most.

### **Looking Ahead**

As I continue my work, I hope to combine everything I’ve learned—robotics, proprioception assessment, and neuromodulation—into integrated solutions for rehabilitation. My vision is to make these therapies scalable and accessible, so they can help people no matter where they are, from cutting-edge hospitals to underserved communities.
