**Timeline:** 2018–2023  

### **The Beginning: A Simple Question**
Hand therapy after neurological injuries like **stroke** often requires training a wide range of movements at various hand joints. During my doctoral studies, I was driven by a fundamental question:  
*Can a simple, single-degree-of-freedom robotic system effectively train multiple hand functions?*  

This question stemmed from a pressing need in rehabilitation—creating devices that are compact, affordable, and relevant to clinical and home settings, especially in resource-limited environments. Complex robots, while advanced, often lack accessibility and cost-effectiveness. **PLUTO** was my answer to this challenge, designed to bridge the gap between technology and real-world usability.

### **System Architecture: Modular and Adaptive**
At the heart of **PLUTO** is its simplicity and adaptability. The system is built around a **single motor** to which **modular passive mechanisms** can be attached. These mechanisms allow the robot to target specific hand functions while keeping the design compact and easy to use.  

The current version of PLUTO supports training for the following five hand functions:  
1. **Wrist flexion/extension (WFE)**  
2. **Wrist ulnar/radial deviation (WURD)**  
3. **Forearm pronation/supination (FPS)**  
4. **Gross hand opening and closing (HOC)**  
5. **Passive finger stretching (PFS)**  

The **universal coupler** makes switching between mechanisms simple, ensuring that the system remains intuitive for patients and therapists alike.

### **Clinical Impact: From Usability to Feasibility**
The clinical journey of PLUTO was one of the most fulfilling parts of my PhD. It began with a **single-session usability study** involving:  
- **15 patients and caregivers**, and  
- **15 clinicians** at the Rehabilitation Institute of CMC Vellore.  

This study provided invaluable insights into PLUTO's usability, leading to further refinements. Following this, I conducted a **two-week feasibility study**, evaluating how in-patients could independently train hand functions using PLUTO.  

One of the most memorable moments was during a **four-week home study**, where a patient from a **remote tribal village**, located 150 kilometers from the nearest hospital, successfully used PLUTO on their own. This experience reinforced for me the true purpose of building affordable and accessible technologies—not just designing devices but creating solutions that reach people who need them the most.

### **What I Learned**
PLUTO is not just a robot; it’s a reflection of my journey as an engineer. Through its development, I learned the **real value of creating affordable and accessible technology**. Engineering is not just about innovation; it’s about ensuring that innovation is meaningful and impactful in the lives of users.  

As of now, PLUTO is used at **six centers across India**, with its **commercial release** planned for **May 2025**. Seeing PLUTO’s impact reaffirms the importance of simplicity in design and dedication to addressing real-world challenges in rehabilitation.
