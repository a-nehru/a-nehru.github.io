**Timeline:** 2023  

### **Motivation**
Motivation is critical in **stroke rehabilitation**, influencing patient engagement, adherence, and recovery. While robotic-assisted rehabilitation is known to enhance therapy intensity, incorporating **multiplayer game modes** could further improve **engagement** through **social interaction**. Collaborative and competitive dynamics can create a sense of support and camaraderie, making therapy more engaging and impactful.

As part of this study, I used **PLUTO**, a hand rehabilitation robot, to evaluate the potential of multiplayer rehabilitation games in enhancing **motivation** and **engagement**.

### **Study Design**
This study explored the impact of **three game modes** implemented on PLUTO:
1. **Solo Mode** – Players independently performed wrist flexion-extension tasks.
2. **Collaborative Mode** – Two participants worked together to achieve a shared goal, requiring coordination and teamwork.
3. **Competitive Mode** – Participants competed against each other to achieve the highest score, with a dynamic repulsive force adding a strategic challenge.

The games were played by **12 unimpaired participants** (6 dyads) who alternated between the modes. Engagement, tension, and competence were measured using the **Intrinsic Motivation Inventory (IMI)** and the **Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS)**.

### **Key Findings**
- **Collaborative Mode Preference:** The collaborative mode was the most preferred, with **10 out of 12 participants** ranking it as their favorite. This mode showed the strongest potential for promoting **behavioral involvement** and **social engagement**.
- **Higher Engagement for Multiplayer Modes:** While there were no statistically significant differences in engagement between solo and multiplayer modes, participants consistently rated multiplayer modes higher on the IMI engagement scale.
- **Improved Solo Performance Post Multiplayer:** Both collaborative and competitive training improved **solo performance metrics**, such as tracking accuracy and movement smoothness.  

These findings suggest that **multiplayer game modes using PLUTO** can effectively enhance engagement, which may translate to better rehabilitation outcomes if applied to patient populations.

### **Game Mechanics**
- **Collaborative Mode:** Players jointly controlled a shared basket, with penalties for slacking to ensure active participation. Coordination was visually represented by a color-coded rope, encouraging synchronized movements.  
- **Competitive Mode:** Players competed to achieve the highest score while navigating a repulsive force, which added strategic complexity.  

Both modes were designed to balance interaction, engagement, and challenge, ensuring the system remained accessible to users with varying skill levels.

### **Personal Insights**
This study deepened my understanding of how **social interaction** and **gamified experiences** can enhance therapy. By using PLUTO to implement multiplayer dynamics, I saw firsthand the potential of leveraging haptic collaboration and competition to make rehabilitation more engaging and effective. These insights will guide future work in designing **interactive robotic therapies**.
