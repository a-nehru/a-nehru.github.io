I’m **Aravind Nehrujee**, a rehabilitation engineer and postdoctoral researcher at **Shirley Ryan AbilityLab (SRAlab)** in Chicago, USA. My work focuses on developing technologies and therapies to help people with sensory-motor impairments regain independence and improve their quality of life.

I strive to create tools that are simple to use yet built on strong scientific and clinical foundations. Whether it’s designing robots for rehabilitation or exploring neuromodulation techniques, my goal is to make advanced therapies accessible and impactful.

### **From PLUTO to Neuromodulation**

During my PhD, I developed **PLUTO**, a hand rehabilitation robot designed to support motor recovery. Over several years, PLUTO evolved through **four versions**, shaped by feedback from **patients, clinicians, and researchers**. I worked directly with **more than 100 patients** and **50 clinicians**, conducting trials with **1,000+ participants** across **seven centers**. It’s now being commercialized and was one of the first robots used in **home-based clinical trials**, helping people access therapy in their own homes.

Now, at SRAlab, I’m building on this foundation by exploring **neuromodulation techniques** like:
- **Acute Intermittent Hypoxia (AIH):** Short bursts of low oxygen to encourage neuroplasticity.
- **Transcutaneous spinal stimulation:** A non-invasive way to improve motor function.

These methods aim to unlock the brain and spinal cord’s ability to adapt and recover, helping to develop therapies that combine science with real-world usability.

### **My Philosophy**

For me, impactful technologies are not just about complexity or innovation—they must also be **translatable** and **usable**. A tool is only as good as the ease with which people can adopt it, whether it’s a clinician in a busy hospital or a patient recovering at home.

I often think about **Google Search** as an example. On the surface, it’s a simple search box that anyone can use. Behind the scenes, though, it’s powered by complex algorithms like **PageRank** and **BERT**, which make it incredibly effective. Similarly, I aim to create rehabilitation tools that feel intuitive to use but are backed by rigorous science and engineering.

This approach ensures that the tools I develop are not only scientifically sound but also practical and scalable for real-world use.

### **How I Got Here**

My journey into rehabilitation engineering began at **CMC Vellore**, one of India’s leading rehabilitation centers. During my master’s, I worked on a **smartphone-based vestibular gaming system** to help patients regain balance. That project sparked my interest in using technology to create meaningful healthcare solutions.

While at CMC, I also visited rural hospitals in **Raxaul, Bihar**, and **Odisha**, where I saw firsthand how limited resources could affect access to care. These experiences shaped my commitment to designing solutions that are **affordable**, **practical**, and **accessible**, ensuring they reach those who need them the most.

### **Looking Ahead**

As I continue my work, I hope to combine everything I’ve learned—robotics, proprioception assessment, and neuromodulation—into integrated solutions for rehabilitation. My vision is to make these therapies scalable and accessible, so they can help people no matter where they are, from cutting-edge hospitals to underserved communities.
